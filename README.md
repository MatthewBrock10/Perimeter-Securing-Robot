# Perimeter-Securing-Robot
Python micro controller guiding a lego mindstorms kit ev3 to secure a perimeter

### Moving the files from written code on computer to robot:

Turn the robot on by pressing the button on the ev3 brick.

Once the robot is completely turned on, connect the computer, using a cable to the 'PC' slot on the ev3 brick.

Connect the ev3 controller on the computer.

Compile the code or drag the code to the correct folder in the controller on the computer.

### Running the code on the robot:

*For best results place down on a smooth table with at least a bit of space.*

Locate 'file explorer' from the initial list presented.

Inside there should be a folder where the code that was just moved to the controller should be.

Move down to it and make sure the robot is set down on a surface.

From there, simply press the middle button on the ev3 brick and watch it set off in motion.

### Stopping the robot:

Press the top left button on the ev3 brick, and it should display the file explorer again, while stopping the robot before it begins the next action.

To turn it off, press that same button until a pop-up appears, where shut down can be selected from a menu.
